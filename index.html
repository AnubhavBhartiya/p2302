								<h2>Deliverables<br /></h2>
								<h2>By Completing the Academic Requirements</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The Very First Deliverable was the newly built <strong>Database</strong> which compiled the 1 Normal form and the
							   designed database also achieved the requirement of Designing the database.   </p>
							<p>The Second Deliverable for this project was <strong>ArcPy scripts</strong> which helped in loading the data from existing
								database to the newly designed database, there were total three scripts made to load the data onto the Database and then build
								relationship class connecting the Primary Key. This Fullfilled the academic requirement of Scripting and Programming.</p>
							<p>The Third deliverable was to make a <strong>Web Map</strong>strong> with appropriate Cartographic Output and make it Visually more appealing
							    So that all the Assets can be displayed properly and can also be analysed in a proper manner so that they can be differentiated by their symbol itself.
							    This Deliverable complted the requirements of the Academic Requirement of Cartography and Visualisation</p>
							<p>The Fourth and the most important deliverable was to make a <strong>Web App</strong> Displaying all the Assets and making the portal interactive for the user
								so that they can access the assets and get the location, further they can access more tools to make it more detailed or show the Specific Requirements. This Web App 
								this web app was made using ArcGIS Online Experience Builder which helped us to get the approprite output and assemble different widgets to get an appropriate tool
								map. This Web App outcome helped us to get the deliverable of Enterprise Technology as different apps from ESRI were used to make the web app.</main></p>
